# LSTM_overcomplete_autoencoder

This repository is created for the code used in the article "LSTM overcomplete autoencoder for anomaly detection of studentsâ€™ clickstream data". The article is prepared for Smarl Learning Environments journal.
This code was initially taken from https://github.com/curiousily/Getting-Things-Done-with-Pytorch/blob/master/06.time-series-anomaly-detection-ecg.ipynb and adapted to the needs of the research.
